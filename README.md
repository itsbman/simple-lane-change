# **Lane Change Path Planning**

This is a simple path planner for lane changing of a vehicle using third degree polynomials. In addition to the vehicle's centre position, it requires two reference path points as input corresponding to the vehicle's current lane and the target lane it will lane change to. Curvature of the path can be adjusted using the delay points and target points.
